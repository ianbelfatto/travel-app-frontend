# PLNNR
PLNNR (or Planner), provides a way for users to plan their trips in a visual data-driven way. Using Yelp's Fusion API and Mapbox CL JS, users can search for businesses and events, see relevant information about them, add them to trips, and see them 1) visualized via markers that auto-populate based on coordinates from Yelp Fusion, and 2) visualized via stylized data below the map to see things like rating, phone number, location, photos, & more.
